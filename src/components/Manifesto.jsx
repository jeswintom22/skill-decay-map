        Skills do not stay stable when unused.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most systems assume that if you are not improving, you are maintaining.
        That assumption is false.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skills decay quietly.
        People usually notice only after the loss becomes painful.
      </p>

      <p>
        This map does not test you.
        It does not score you.
        It does not reward consistency.
      </p>

      <p>
        It models risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each point represents a skill you chose to care about.
        Its distance reflects how central it is.
        Its size reflects its importance.
        Its color reflects how long it has been unused.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a skill drifts toward decay, nothing is demanded of you.
        The system simply reflects reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Awareness comes before recovery.
